# Stock_Price_Tracker
A UiPath automation that creates a personal stock price tracker using the Finnhub.io API, complete with data visualization.

HOW TO USE:
  - This automation uses the Finnhub.io "Quotes" API to return various stock price metrics for a given stock symbol. 
  - The "Main" workflow is configured to read a .txt file containing the API key; You will need a Finnhub.io account to generate a key.
  - The Excel file is included in the project file with preset values that can be removed. Alternatively, a new Excel file can be
    created and referenced if needed. 
  - Make sure all filepaths for Excel and .txt file references are correct before running.
